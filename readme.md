# CARO - Cloud Assisted Record and Operation

## prerequisites
* php >= 8
* mysql or sql server (or some other database, but queries may have to be adjusted. as i chose pdo as database connectivity i hope this is possible)
* ssl (camera access for qr-scanner and serviceworkers don't work otherwise)
* vendor pricelists as csv-files - one per vendor

tested server environments:
* apache [uniform server zero XV](https://uniformserver.com) with php 8.2, mysql 8.0.31
* microsoft iis with sql express (sql server 22)

tested devices:
* desktop pc win10 edge-browser
* notebook win11 firefox-browser
* smartphone android12 firefox-browser

## installation
* php.ini memory_limit ~1024MB for processing of large csv-files, disable open_basedir at least for local iis for file handlers
* my.ini (MySQL) max_allowed_packet = 100M
* manually set mime type for site-webmanifest as application/manifest+json for iis servers
* set up api/setup.ini, especially the used sql subset and its credentials
* run api/install.php, you will be redirected to the frontpage afterwards - no worries, in case of a rerun nothing will happen

## limitations and intended usecases
* dragging doesn't work on handhelds for touch-events do not include this function. constructing form components and forms will need devices with mice or a supported pointer to avoid bloating scripts.
* orders can be deleted at any time. this module is for operational communication only, not for persistent documentation purpose.
